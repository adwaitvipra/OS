Use the debugfs tool available on Linux 
	to locate a recently deleted file on ext2 layout file system. 
		Carry out the task in following steps :

    Create a file of a specific size like 10kb. 
	This can be done using the dd command.

    Note down the inode number 
	and the blocks for the file (using 'stat' in debugfs)

    Verify that the parent directory data blocks 
	DOES have entry for file.
	For this read the data blocks of directory 
		and look for filename string in it.

    Delete the file using “rm” command. 
	This deletes the link from directory, 
		and changes bitmaps, but data blocks are not touched.

    Verify that the parent directory data blocks 
	do not have entry for deleted file.
	For this read the data blocks of directory
		 and look for filename string in it.

    You should STILL be able to locate 
	all the data blocks of the file 
		and see the data in the file.

    Verify contents of group descriptor and superblock, 
	(no of free indodes, number of free blocks, etc) 
		before deletion and after deletion of the file.

    Note: 
	you need to unmount the partition, 
		before the changes done using "rm" 
			are actually flushed to the disk.

	Debugfs uses system calls (read, write..) to get information
		 and kernel often caches the disk blocks in it's memory,
			and changes may not be flushed 
				to disk unless you do a umount.
