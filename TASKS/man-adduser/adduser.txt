Now try adding a user "by-hand", that is by manually changing the files 

/etc/passwd
/etc/shadow 
/etc/group 

(and, any other files?), and creating home folder, etc.Â 

Play with the "id", "su" commands, see /etc/shells file,  "sudo -u " command; manpages of setuid, getuid, setgid, getgid; ...

challenge:
	write a script or program to add user
	recreate adduser
