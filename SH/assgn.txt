Assignment: Write a Shell

Aim: To write a shell.

The shell should have following features:

	1) Read commands in a loop and run commands without complete path names
		 and handle arguments+options for commands(2 marks)

	2) show prompt with current working directory in the prompt
		 and allow user to change the prompt to a particular string
			 and revert back to CWD prompt (2 marks)
		PS1:
			This should be done with following two commands, with specified syntax:
				PS1="whatever string you want "
				PS1="\w$"
		cd:
			This also mandates that the "cd" command should work:
				Note that "cd" is always an internal command of shell, and not an executable.
				It affects the cwd of the shell itself.

	3) Handle all possible user input errors  (1 marks)

	4) exit gracefully on typing "exit" or CTRL-D  (1 marks)
		EOF is CTRL-D.

	5) allow users to set a variable called PATH
		 which is used for searching the list of executables
			(just like in the case of 'bash' shell)   (2 marks)
		
		PATH:
			This should be done with a command that has following syntax
				PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/sbin
		
		This combined with first point means that you will NOT be using execvp(),
			but rather implement a version of execvp() on your own.
	
	6) Implement input redirection and output redirection - 1 marks each.


	7) Note:

		There will be a stage-2 of this assignment
			where you will be required to extend your code 
				to include features like history, pipes, 
					handling signals (CTRL-C, CTRL-Z), fg, bg, etc;
