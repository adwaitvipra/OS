	LINUX /		-> 64GiB, EXT4
5. Some wrong installations:
	1. Installed Minix3, GRUB did not show up, no way to access other OS's.
	2. Live booted from Linux Slax, was unable to install it on HDD.
	3. Installed Open Solaris on new partition after fedora.
		Open solaris was using old version of GRUB, which was
		unable to detect Fedora. Windows was listed twice, one of which
